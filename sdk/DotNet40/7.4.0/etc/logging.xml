	<!-- .NET application configuration file
	The .NET Compact Framework does not support application configuration files,
	but log4net supports using configuration files with similar names and structure,
	to store the log4net configuration.
	-->

	<!-- By default the FileAppender holds an exclusive write lock on the log file while it is 
	logging. This prevents other processes from writing to the file. 
	The FileAppender can be configured to use a different locking model, MinimalLock, 
	that only acquires the write lock while a log is being written. 
	This allows multiple processes to interleave writes to the same file, 
	albeit with a loss in performance
	-->


	<!-- RollingFileAppender properties can be changed by adding the following attributes 
	maximumFileSize specifies the maximum size that the output file is allowed to reach before being rolled over to 	
	backup files. You can use suffixes "KB", "MB" or "GB" to denote kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes. The default 		
	maximum file size is 10MB. 

	maxSizeRollBackups specifies the maximum number of backup files that are kept before the oldest is erased. The 		
	maximum applies to each time-based group of files and not the total. If set to zero, then there will be no backup 	
	files and the log file will be truncated when it reaches MaxFileSize. If set to a negative number, then the Client 	
	will not delete any files, which could result in very slow performance as a large number of files are rolled over 	
	unless CountDirection is used. 

	CountDirection indicates if the current file is the lowest numbered file or the highest numbered file. By default, 	
	newer files have lower numbers (CountDirection less than zero), that is, log.1 is most recent, log.5 is the 
	5th backup, and so on. CountDirection of zero or greater does the opposite: log.1 is the first backup made, log.5 is 
	the 5th backup made, and so on. For infinite backups use CountDirection greater than or equal to zero to reduce 
	rollover costs. The default value is -1.
